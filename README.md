# 🎨 Image Compression with K-Means (from Scratch)

This project demonstrates how unsupervised learning can be used to compress images by reducing the number of colors.  
Using K-means clustering, each pixel is assigned to one of *K* centroids, simplifying the image while preserving its essence.

## 🧠 What’s Inside
- Full implementation of K-means from scratch (no scikit-learn)
- Compression of movie posters to 16 colors (number of colors can be modified)
- Visual comparisons: original vs. compressed
- Option to change the number of clusters (K) for experimentation

## 📁 Files
- `Image_Compression.ipynb`: Main notebook with code and plots
- Sample outputs: Compressed posters of *12 Angry Men*, *Birdman*, *Atonement*, and *Devil’s Advocate*

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
2. Upload your own image or use the provided examples
3. Set your desired number of clusters (K)
4. Run the cells and view the compressed output
